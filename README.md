# DevOps Challenge
- Use Terraform to create a cluster on Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS). 
- Install RabbitMQ via helm chart using a method of your choice from here:
> https://github.com/bitnami/charts/tree/master/bitnami/rabbitmq
- Configure the RabbitMQ's helm chart to use an existing kubernetes secret for rabbitmq user password.
- Document any issues with deployment or problems you encountered and how you fixed them along the way.
- Commit your configuration for the completed project to a public Git repo and provide the url so we can run our own instance.
